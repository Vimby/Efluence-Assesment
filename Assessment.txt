1. min = 1
   max = 100

   Total = 0

for num in range(min, max+ 1)
  if(num % 2 ! =0)
    print('{0}'.format(num))
    Total = Total + num


 2.The main difference is that the stack follows the Last In First Out principle and Queues are based on the First In First Out principle.
  

3. Time complexity of inserting an element into a hash table is O(1).

4.  min = 1
    max = 100

    Total = 0

   for num in range(min, max+ 1)
     if(num % 2 =0)
    print('{0}'.format(num))
    Total = Total + num

5 & 6. def foo(x):
        if x > 10 ? True : False

7. A stack linear data structure implies that the element that is inserted last is the first to come out  from the list
     whilst Queues the first element that is inserted in the list first.

8. SELECT * FROM employees
   WHERE salary >  $50 000

9. I handle conflicts by editing the conflicting files and selecting which changes to incorporate to a new commit from the different conflicting branches.

10. A client website was returning 404 on heroku. I used heroku logs and google console  to determine the bug.
    The database hosted on another server was not working and it crashed the site. I rectified the error by fixing the database.

11. SELECT * FROM customers
    WHERE total cost > $100

12. replaceAll() method

13. Sort method

14. min = 1
    max = 100

    Total = 0

   for num in range(min, max+ 1)
     if(num % 2 =0)
    print('{0}'.format(num))
    Total = Total + num

15. SELECT * FROM customers
    WHERE total cost > $100


16. <a href="/">Learn more</a>

17. A block level element takes up the full width and always starts on a new line
An inline element can take up any width and can be rendered in a block.

20. url = https://users.com/api/users

 print(users)

21. url = https://users.com/api
    json= { 'user': Vee}

    user= request.post(
        url,
        json
